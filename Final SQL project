here is used the database for kinda like a spotify app and came up with a lot of questions to ask myself as well as questions the instructor gave me. I will provide the question and my SQL answers.

Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. 

  SELECT CustomerID, FirstName, Country
  FROM customers
  Where Country != 'USA'

Show only the Customers from Brazil.

  SELECT *
 FROM customers
 WHERE country ='Brazil';

Show customers first and last name from Canada

  SELECT FirstName, LastName
  FROM customers
  WHERE country = 'Canada'

Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceID, inv.InvoiceDate, inv.BillingCountry 
FROM Customers AS cust
Join invoices AS inv
ON cust.CustomeriD = inv.CustomerId
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'Brazil'

Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT LastName, FirstName, Title
FROM employees
WHERE title = 'Sales Support Agent';


Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM invoices;
